# void-unsanitary-packages
Just a collection of unoffical templates that are usefull for me, but not really for the main void repo.

# Usage
Run `./unsanitary.sh` and then cd into void-packages. Templates are copied from the templates directory into the void-packages directory, so you will need to rerun `unsanitary.sh` after editing the packages in the `templates` directory.

If you need to update void-packages, just simply rerun `unsanitary.sh`. (WARNING: Any files in the `void-packages/srcpkgs` directory will be deleted.)
